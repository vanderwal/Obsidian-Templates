# Obsidian Templates

## Overview of vanderwal's Obsidian Templates

These are templates I've used and honed for Obsisian since 2020. These templates are Obsidian Templates, which I converted from TextExpander templates which I use with Obsidian, Drafts, and many other markdown editors.

These are shared for your use and to get ideas from how one person honed something that worked for themself. 

The two templates I use the most are my Daily Dump (my daily notes) and Book Note.
