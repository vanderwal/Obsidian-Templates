# Obsidian Templates

## Overview of vanderwal's Obsidian Templates

These are templates I've used and honed for Obsisian since 2020. These templates are Obsidian Templates, which I converted from TextExpander templates which I use with Obsidian, Drafts, and many other markdown editors.

These are shared for your use and to get ideas from how one person honed something that worked for themself.
