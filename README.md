# Obsidian Templates

## Overview of vanderwal's Obsidian Templates

These are templates I've used and honed for Obsisian since 2020. These templates are Obsidian Templates, which I converted from TextExpander templates which I use with Obsidian, Drafts, and many other markdown editors.

These are shared for your use and to get ideas from how one person honed something that worked for themself. 

The two templates I use the most are my Daily Dump (my daily notes) and Book Note.

## Template Notes

### Book Search Template
This is used with the book search plug-in and sets up the initial "book" note, which links to the "book note" for the book. This started as a Zettlekasten approach, but my personal use found modifying that was a more helpful to myself. I keep the book search to capture the metadata for the book from Google Books through the plug-in. I often copy and paste the metadata into the book's "Book Note" note and make quick modifications to add "Book Note" modifications.
